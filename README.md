# Lattice-Physics

Project Description : The project aims at predicting the IMF and PPPF values using Random Forest Algorithm.

potential issues that might be faced : the libraries to be imported might not already be downloaded by pip, tuning or hyperparameters and cross validation will take huge amount of time.
